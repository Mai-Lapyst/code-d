### Prerequirements:
D compiler with environment variables set. Downloads [here](https://dlang.org/download.html), details [here](https://wiki.dlang.org/Compilers)

### code-d installation

* Automatic:
  Open Visual Studio Code and install the _code-d_ extension the normal way:

  ```
  ext install webfreak.code-d
  ```

  Or search for code-d and select the "D Programming Language (code-d)" extension from the list.

* Manual (if the automatic way doesn't work)

    ```
    # discouraged if you are trying out code-d, you should preferably install it from the marketplace

    cd ~/.vscode/extensions/
    git clone https://github.com/Pure-D/code-d.git
    cd code-d
    npm install
    npx tsc -p .
    ```

code-d will automatically install [serve-d](https://github.com/Pure-D/serve-d),
[dcd](https://github.com/dlang-community/DCD) and [dub](https://code.dlang.org/download)
